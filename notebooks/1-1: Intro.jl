# Historical Context

Twenty-nine years ago at the Astronomical Data Analysis Software and Systems (ADASS) VI meeting (1996), Harrington and Barrett hosted a Birds-of-a-Feather session entitled [Interactive Data Analysis Environments](https://www.cv.nrao.edu/adass/adassVI/harringtonj.html). Based on their review of [21 interpreted programming languages](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/barrettp/AAS245Julia/blob/main/Interactive%20Data%20Analysis%20Environments.html) such as Glish, GUILE, IDL, IRAF, Matlab, Perl, Python, and Tcl; they recommended that Python be considered the primary language for astronomical data analysis. The primary reasons were that the language was simple to learn, yet powerful; well supported by the programming community; and had FORTRAN-like arrays. However, for good performance, the multi-dimensional arrays needed to be written in a compiled language, namely C. So Numerical or Scientific Python suffers from the **two language problem**: an interpreted language for interactive use and a compiled language for performance.

## Why Julia?

In 2009, four faculty and staff members[^1] at MIT, who were not satisfied with the state of scientific computing, decided to develop a general purpose, high performance, scientific programming language. After ten years of development, they release Julia Version 1.0 on August 8, 2018. Their aim was to create an open-source interpreted language that was concise, extensible, and high performance.

!!! info
	We are greedy.
	
	We want a language that's open source, with a liberal license. We want the speed of C with the dynamism of Ruby. We want a language that's homoiconic, with true macros like Lisp, but with obvious, familiar mathematical notation like Matlab. We want something as usable for general programming as Python, as easy for statistics as R, as natural for string processing as Perl, as powerful for linear algebra as Matlab, as good at gluing programs together as the shell. Something that is dirt simple to learn yet, keeps the most serious hackers happy. We want it interactive and we want it compiled.

	(Jeff Bezanson, 2012)

## Why Have I migrated to Julia?

Although an early advocate and developer of Numerical Python (now NumPy), Matplotlib, and PyFits (now astropy.io.fits), I knew its limitations, namely, the two language problem. Therefore, once a better scientific programming language came along, I was prepared to migrate to that language. I believe that **Julia is that language.** It is the language that I envisioned thirty years ago.

## Help: `?`

For help mode:

```julia-repl
julia> ?

help?> println
search: println printstyled print sprint isprint

println([io::IO], xs...)

Print (using print) xs to io followed by a newline. If io is not supplied, prints to the default output stream stdout.

See also printstyled to add colors etc

Examples
≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡

julia> println("Hello, world")
Hello, world

julia> io = IOBuffer();

julia> println(io, "Hello", ',', " world.")

julia> String(take!(io))
"Hello, world.\n"

    Pluto has a **Live docs** tab in the lower right corner that will display the current Julia function or command. The **Help**, **Shell**, and **Package Manager** examples require the REPL, i.e., running Julia in a terminal.

## Package Manager: `]`

For package mode:

```julia-repl
julia> ]

pkg>
```

For package manager help,

```julia-repl
pkg> ? `return`
```

returns a brief summary of package commands.

To add a package:

```julia-repl
pkg> add <package>

pkg> add <package1>, <package2>
```

When adding a package, the Julia online repository (aka the "registry") will be searched. The package and its dependencies will then be downloaded, compiled, and installed. This may take anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes depending on the size of the package and its dependencies.

To use or load a package (after it has been added):

```julia-repl
julia> using <package>

julia> using <package1>, <package2>
```

A feature of the `using` command is that it will add the package, if it hasn't already been added.

# Summary

    What have we learned about the Julia command line and features?

    * Julia has four command line modes: **REPL**, **help**, **shell**, and **package manager**.

    * Julia understands **unicode**.

    * Julia packages are **composable**. It means that independent packages are compatible and work together without modification, as demonstrated by the `Measurements` and `Unitful` packages.

    * Julia can perform symbolic manipulation using the `Symbolics` package.

    * Julia can perform calculations on the GPU without resorting to compiled languages such as C/C++.
